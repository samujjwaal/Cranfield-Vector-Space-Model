  heat-transfer and skin-friction
parameters obtained from exact
numerical solutions to the laminar
compressible-boundary-layer equations
for the infinite cylinder in yaw are
presented .  the chordwise flow in
the transformed plane is of the
falkner-skan type .  solutions are given
for chordwise stagnation flow with
both a porous and a nonporous wall .
the effect of a linear viscositytemperature
relation is compared with
the effect of the sutherland viscositytemperature
relation at the stagnation
line of the cylinder for a
prandtl number of 0.7 .  the effects of
pressure gradient, mach number, yaw
angle, and wall temperature are investigated
for a linear viscosity-temperature
relation and a prandtl number
of 1.0 with a nonporous wall .
  the results indicate that compressibility
effects become important
at large mach numbers and yaw angles,
with larger percentage effects on
the skin friction than on the heat
transfer .  the use of the two different
viscosity relations gives about the
same results except when large changes
in temperature occur across the boundary
layer, as for a highly cooled
wall .  the present solutions predict that
a larger amount of coolant would
be required at a given large mach number
and yaw angle than would be predicted
from solutions of the corresponding
incompressible-boundary-layer
equations .
