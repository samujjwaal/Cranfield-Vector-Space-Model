  taylor's analysis of the intense spherical explosion
has been extended to the cylindrical case .  it is found
that the radius r of a strong cylindrical shock wave
produced by a sudden release of energy e per unit length
grows with time t according to the equation
where is the atmospheric density and
is a calculated function of the specific
heat ratio .  for is found to be approximately
unity .  for this case, the pressure behind the
shock wave decays with radius r according to the relation .
applying the results of this analysis
to the case of hypersonic flight, it can be shown that
the shock envelope behind a meteor or a high-speed
missile is approximately a paraboloid given by
where d and v denote the total
drag and the velocity of the missile, respectively,
and x is the distance behind the missile .
