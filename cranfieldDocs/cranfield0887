<TEXT>
  thermal stress distributions in uniform circular cylindrical shells
due to axial temperature distributions are investigated .  the discontinuity
effect due to the presence of a cooler stiffening bulkhead is
considered, and the possibility of thermal buckling of the shell due to
the circumferential discontinuity stress is examined .  the buckling
analysis is based on donnell's shell equation, and particular attention
is given to shells having clamped edges .
  an experimental investigation of this buckling problem is discussed,
and the results obtained are seen to agree reasonably well with theory .
