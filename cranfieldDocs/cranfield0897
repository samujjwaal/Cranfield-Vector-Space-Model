  in this summary paper, the
effects of initial deformations on the
buckling and postbuckling characteristics
of circular cylindrical
shells under hydrostatic pressure
is determined in an approximate manner
.  the influence of initial
axisymmetric deformations is stressed .
also, the classical buckling of
an axially compressed, noncircular
the results show that the majorminor
axis ratio of the cross section
has a marked effect on the
critical load, and that use of the
maximum radius of curvature in the
formula for the classical buckling
stress of a circular cylindrical
shell leads to good results for moderate
eccentricities .
