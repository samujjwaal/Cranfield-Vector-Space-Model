<TEXT>
  a theory of creep buckling is presented in which the instantaneous
elastic and plastic deformations following the application of a load, as
well as the steady creep deformations, are considered in an approximate
manner .  equations are given from which the critical time, that is, the
time elapsing between load application and the collapse of the column,
can be computed .
