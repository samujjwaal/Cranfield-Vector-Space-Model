  the problem of the ion density distribution around a
charged satellite has been treated by a numerical method
which does not require linearization of the equations or restriction
to infinitesimal objects .  however, magnetic field
effects were not considered, and a number of other simplifying
assumptions were required .  some sample calculations
for spherical satellites are presented, illustrating the general
character of the satellite wake .  calculations of the socalled
/charge drag/ were also made, yielding results qualitatively
similar to those previously obtained by jastrow and pearse .
