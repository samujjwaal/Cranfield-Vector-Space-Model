an investigation of the effects of the interaction ahead of a twodimensional
sonic jet exhausting perpendicularly into a mach number
were made at an angle of attack of 0degree at a reynolds number per foot
 of approximately 6 x 10 and with conditions of both transitional and
turbulent separation on the flat plate . the ratio of jet stagnation
pressure to free-stream static pressure was varied from 8 to 460 and the
 jet slot width was varied from 0.001 to 0.05 inch . the force ratio
 due to reaction of jet/, calculated ahead of the jet, was sizable and
varied from 0.5 to 9 . in general, the ratio increased with increasing
pressure ratio and decreasing slot width . for the turbulent boundarylayer
separation tests it was found that the first peak pressure and the
 chordwise pressure distribution of the separated boundary layer ahead
of the jet were similar to those for a separation caused by a forwardfacing
step at the same test conditions .
