  a general method of solution is given in this paper for
the problem of bending of a wedge-shaped thin elastic
plate with arbitrary boundary conditions on the radial edges
in the case of a single load .  the solution is carried out for
a plate with clamped edges and a single load on the bisector
radius of the plate .  stress distribution along the edges
is shown and the behavior of the solution near the corner
point is discussed for several opening angles of the plate .
