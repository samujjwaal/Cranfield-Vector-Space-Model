  the problem of optimal zoom climb maneuvering of a turbojet
aircraft has been investigated using the mayer formulation of the
calculus of variations .  the euler-lagrange equations governing
optimum symmetric flight have been integrated numerically by
digital computation .
  discontinuities in thrust arising from turbojet afterburner
blowout have been treated, and conditions which must be satisfied
across the interface generated by the discontinuity have been
derived .
  arbitrary control techniques have been compared with the
optimum, and it has been found that performance is relatively
insensitive to piloting technique unless a time limitation is imposed
which requires high maneuvering load factors .
