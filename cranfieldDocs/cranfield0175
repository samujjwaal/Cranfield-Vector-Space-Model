  systematic tests have been made at a mach
number of 1.6 on a family of static tubes .  the variables
which have been investigated are the shape of the nose, the
distance of the holes downstream, and the inclination of
the tube to the flow .  pressure measurements have also been
made in the vicinity of a shock wave and close to a wall .
