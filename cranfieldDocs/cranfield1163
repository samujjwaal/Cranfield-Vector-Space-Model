  a wind-tunnel investigation has
been made to determine the aerodynamic
characteristics of a scale
model of a tilt-wing vertical-takeoff-and-landing
aircraft .  the model
had two 3-blade single-rotation
propellers with hinged (flapping)
blades mounted on the wing, which
could be tilted from an incidence
of 4 for forward flight to 86 for
hovering flight .
  the investigation included
measurements of both the longitudinal
and lateral stability and control
characteristics in both the normal
forward flight and the transition
ranges .  tests in the forward-flight
condition were made for several values
of thrust coefficient, and tests
in the transition condition were made
at several values of wing incidence
with the power varied to cover a range
of flight conditions from forwardacceleration
(or climb) conditions to
deceleration (or descent) conditions
the control effectiveness of the
all-movable horizontal tail, the ailerons
and the differential propeller pitch
control was also determined .  the
data are presented without analysis .
