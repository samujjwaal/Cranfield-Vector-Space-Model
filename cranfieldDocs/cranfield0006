  in a recent contribution to the readers'
forum wassermann gave analytic
solutions for the temperature in a double
layer slab, with a triangular heat
rate input at one face, insulated at the other,
and with no thermal resistance
at the interface .  his solutions were for the
three particular cases..
i propose here to give the general solution
to this problem, to indicate
briefly how it is obtained using the method of
reference 2, and to point out
that the solutions given by wassermann are
incomplete for times longer
than the duration of the heat input .
