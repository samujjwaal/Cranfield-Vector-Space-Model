  a theoretical investigation of symmetric
body freedom flutter of a rocket model is described .  the results
confirm that structural failures of models were caused
by this type of flutter, and an extension of the investigation
indicates the parameters that are of importance .  a high
ratio of body to wing mass and a well forward position of the
overall centre of gravity are conditions under which flutter
may occur .  increase of body pitching radius of gyration
and tailplane volume are beneficial .
  it is concluded that this type of flutter may be significant
in some aircraft designs, and that the canard has no
advantage in this respect over the conventional lay-out of wing
and tailplane .
