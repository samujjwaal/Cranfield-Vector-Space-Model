<TEXT>
the use of stage characteristics obtained from test data in the performance
analysis and development of an axial-flow compressor is described
relative stage matching as shown by an idealized example and also by
test experience . factors governing major performance parameters are
discussed and certain development problems and possible solutions are
reviewed .
