  the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wake
configuration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is an extremely
important one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the total
drag of a given body may be attributable to the low pressure in
this region .  although a great deal of theoretical and experimental
work has been done in this field, there does not yet exist a satisfactory
method for accurate predictions .
  this paper represents an excellent effort to experimentally confirm
analytically deduced concepts .  a large amount of experimental
data on body shapes such as wedges, cones, and conecylinders
has been obtained over a range of mach numbers up to 4 .
the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical deductions
.  on the basis of the evidence accumulated it is concluded
that the boundary-layer thickness has only a small effect
on the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and for twodimensional
bodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are of
the order .
  reviewer believes this report is a significant contribution in the
field of base pressure and wake flow phenomena .
