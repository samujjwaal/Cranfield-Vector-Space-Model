  the flow of viscous electrically conducting fluid
past a semi-infinite plate is considered .  the applied
constant magnetic field and the constant oncoming
velocity of the fluid are in the direction parallel
to the plate .
  in addition to reynolds number the flow in the
boundary layer depends on two parameters
and .  the two simultaneous
ordinary nonlinear differential equations are solved by
the asymptotic method for the cases when
and respectively .
  the main results obtained are as follows .  the equations
can be solved exactly for and  .
the perturbation effect from infinity when k is large
depends on, whereas the perturbation effect from
zero when k is small depends on .  for large k, including
there is no solution for .  it is
assumed that the fluid is incompressible with constant
physical properties .
