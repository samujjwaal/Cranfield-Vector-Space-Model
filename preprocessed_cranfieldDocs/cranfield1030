note on creep buckling of columns .

  some general topics in elastic stability are discussed .  in
particular, attention is given to the relationship between adjacentequilibrium-position
and energy techniques, to the effects of nonlinearity,
and to the sensitivity of certain stability problems to the
character of the loading .
