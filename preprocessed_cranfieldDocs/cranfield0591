an approximate equation for the /choke line/ of a compressor .

discussion of a similarity between the pressure-ratio versus inletmass-flow-coefficient
characteristic of a stream or gas turbine and the
analogous characteristic of an expansion /laval/ nozzle . this idea is
extended to a compressor and a compression nozzle, and an approximate
expression for the /choke line/ of the compressor is developed .
